# ops200-deploy-all-things

## 
The purpose of this project was to take the three projects built in Web102 and deploy it to Heroku. The first thing that had to be done was rearrange the folders within each project as well as add information such as new dependencies. This was done strictly using front-end projects. Intitally, through the use of a basic Node and Express server, these projects were deployed. The original projects can be found in the other repositories but the links to the Heroku deployments can also be found here:
